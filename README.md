# Briefing-app

## TODOs:
- When, on settings screen page:
    - Change settings button behaviour to return to home page
    - Change settings icon to show a home page
- When returning to home page, clear search bar text

- Fav airports
    - Order (drag and drop, alphabetically, etc)
    - Ability to delete one by one

- Move "Delete all favorites" to settings page


- Filter favs when typing IATA on searchbar
- Show crosswind and headwind components
- Cache last metars on a new context, so that, without connection, cached metar is used. This context may also store last update time to be shown

## Optional TODOs:
- Show nearby airports (this possibly needs a backend or a JSON file with airports and coordinates)
- Create timeline and filter "forecast" according to time
